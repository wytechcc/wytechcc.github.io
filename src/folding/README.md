If you've got a lab that's sitting idle, consider donating
computing time to [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/iamoneinamillion/)

We're working on automating folding deployments in the following
environments, and for the following use cases:


1. [ ] Powershell
2. [ ] Ansible
3. [ ] Terraform
4. [ ] Docker-Compose
5. [ ] Docker-Swarm

* [ ] School District Computer Labs
* [ ] Library Computer Labs
* [ ] Business Server Blades
* [ ] Cloud IaaS (AWS, GCE, DO)

Visit the [CovidComputerLab](https://github.com/wytechcc/CovidComputerLab) repo for
our automation scripts. We need lab administrators to help triage deployments!

> will add the github repository shortly.
