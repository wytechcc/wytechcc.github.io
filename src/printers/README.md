The current, coordinated list of 3D printers & CNC routers being
used around the state is in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18XFfVQ6zzTczFEgAISl7-t_jBeOvYMFAfBuuKGrW6yU/edit?ts=5e84028d#gid=0)

There are 68 pieces of equipment in total. They include PLA, ABS, PETG, Resin, PC-ISO, Nylon, Stainless steel, CNC (48x96), & a laser etcher.

## Getting Materials to Hospitals

Hospitals will vet and select the 3D files they want printed. See "My Organization Needs Help" on the sidebar. The google form for doing that is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHdd5w5zCr35c99aNIKwiBEvNFNuNkJJcgQCCIdYEK9lX0mQ/viewform).

the coordinated effort by the government (FDA, VA, America Makes) approves PPE designs here:

## Needs - Supply Chain Bottlenecks!
* If you know a vendor for PETG, polycarbonate, or 0.020"/0.030" thin transparent plastic, add them to the [Vendors and Material Suppliers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18XFfVQ6zzTczFEgAISl7-t_jBeOvYMFAfBuuKGrW6yU/edit#gid=751659476) section of the statewide equipment and resources sheet
* hospitals seem to want PETG or ABS, PETG is a bit brittle with the current hole placements.
